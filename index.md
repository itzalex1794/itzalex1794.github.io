## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 7, part 1 
This Parking Rules lab is one of my favorite labs because even though it was challenging at first, the logic was also surprisingly straightforward once I broke it down and analyzed everything. Working with the main function made me appreciate how many different checks a real parking system needs. For example, validating the street, day, hour, and minute before anything else like in my code where I return errors for invalid streets, bad days, or impossible times showed me how important input handling is. I also really liked this lab because it showed how programming can directly model real-world systems.And the wonder of how apps know when parking is allowed or not, and through this assignment I was finally able to see how the rules break down into simple Boolean expressions and conditions.

* Lab 6, part 2
This Blackjack Score lab was also one of my favorites because it finally showed me how the logic behind the game actually works. While writing functions like IsAce, IsFaceCard, and TwoCardHandScore, I realized how much detail goes into something as simple as calculating a card total. It was also interesting to see how the ace bonus works in real code, especially once I implemented the check that prevents a bust. Using my own functions in main to validate inputs and handle errors which made the project feel like a complete program. Andn seeing my code run successfully and pass all the tests made me feel like my programming skills were really improving.

* Lab 11, part 2
This Hi-Lo Game lab also became one of my favorites as I finally felt my coding skills come together, especially while completing the GameState methods in hilo_functions.cc. And seeing how my functions like GuessCorrect, GuessTooBig, and GameOver actually work in the full program making the assignment feel both useful and rewarding. While additionally also being very clear, straightforward, and even letting me and my partner leave class a little early once everything was working. And since this was the most recent lab we completed, I feel like I could really notice how much improvment I had made compared to the very first lab we did.
